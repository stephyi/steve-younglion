                            <p><strong>Training for Mass</strong></p>

                            <p>
                                Big bodies are the result of big weights being moved in the gym. You have to attempt to be stronger each week, whether it’s increasing the weight or the reps. Handling more weight on all your exercises or doing the same weight but increasing the reps are great indicators that you are gaining more muscle and you’re well on your way to being one with the masses!
                                
                                It is important that you keep the weight heavy and the sets shorter. Your goal is to continuously expose your genotype (your DNA) to heavy weight for relatively short bursts. As you get used to the weight, progressively increase that weight. You will always need to be forcing your body to adapt to and overcome new levels of resistance (weight).</p>


                            <p><strong>Eating for Mass</strong></p>


                            <p>
                                If your a hard gainer, as in you have a very difficult time putting on mass and keeping it on, you have to realize that your genetics predispose you to degrading any muscle that you put on. To prevent this, you have to dramatically increase the amount you eat per meal and you have to increase the frequency of the meals. Hard gainers who have successfully gained mass eat between 5 and 7 meals per day and aim to have their calorie intake at 4,000 to 5,000 calories per day with their protein intake at 2 or more grams of protein per pound of bodyweight per day (if you’re 150 lbs. aim for 300 g of protein).
                                
                                This sounds tough, and it is. Your body will fight you every step of the way. But that’s how you know that you’re doing the right thing. If it was easy, you would already be huge, right?!</p>


                            <p>There is a place for higher reps in any program. In fact, I incorporated some on my "conditioning" days. But training heavy plays an important role in your ability to grow. That's because focusing on heavier weight increases your strength. And as you increase your strength, you can use more weight for more reps. And as your total work capacity increases (amount of weight you use multiplied by the number of reps you perform), you are able to add more mass.

                                You'll want to be smart about your approach. The downside of heavier lifting is that it can put you at a greater likelihood of injury. So doing a proper and thorough warmup, as well as several work-up sets, will ensure that you body--and your muscles, tendons, and ligaments--are prepared to add more weight, become stronger, and stay injury free.</p>

                            <p>One of the biggest mistakes when trying to gain weight is eating the wrong types of food. Gaining weight can be hard for some people. (And yes, people that struggle to lose weight do not want to hear about your "difficulties" stuffing your face, but both can be equally challenging.) When you hit that wall, your first instinct might be to eat the most calorically dense foods possible. Scarfing down pizza and donuts might help you gain weight — but not the type you want.

                                Remember the goal is mass, but more muscle and less fat is what you want. So you'll want to eat foods that are dense in calories — think steak and potatoes — as well as foods that have nutritional value and will help with digestion, like greens and sauerkraut.
                                
                                While you will have more room to take in extra calories, if those calories are all from the bad sources you will grow — in all the wrong ways. </p>
